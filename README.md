Happy Weather (Weather Dashboard)

Problem Statement 

A reliable weather dashboard is essential for travelers, outdoor planners, and everyday users who want quick and accurate weather updates. The goal of this project is to develop a real-time weather dashboard named "Happy Weather" that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and presents it in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. Users should be able to search for a city and receive a 5-day weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, air quality and general weather conditions. Additionally, the application should feature interactive elements, including a map, relevant images, temperature convertor and a weather-related quiz to educate users about climate patterns.

Solution Architecture & Workflow

1.	User enters city name in the search bar.
2.	
3.	API Request: The frontend sends an API request to OpenWeather API to fetch weather data.
4.	
5.	Display Weather Data: The received data is processed and displayed, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
6.	
7.	Weather Icons: Based on conditions, appropriate weather icons are shown.
8.	
9.	Map Integration: The Google Maps API fetches the city‚Äôs coordinates and displays its location.
10.	
11.	City Images: The application fetches and displays images related to the searched city.
12.	
13.	Interactive Quiz: Users can engage in a fun weather-related quiz below the dashboard.
14.	
15.	Error Handling: If an invalid city is entered, a proper error message is displayed.
16.
