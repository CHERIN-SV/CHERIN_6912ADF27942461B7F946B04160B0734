Happy Weather (Weather Dashboard)

Problem Statement 

A reliable weather dashboard is essential for travelers, outdoor planners, and everyday users who want quick and accurate weather updates. The goal of this project is to develop a real-time weather dashboard named "Happy Weather" that fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and presents it in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. Users should be able to search for a city and receive a 5-day weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, air quality and general weather conditions. Additionally, the application should feature interactive elements, including a map, relevant images, temperature convertor and a weather-related quiz to educate users about climate patterns.
